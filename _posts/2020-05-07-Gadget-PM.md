USB Power Management has some modules:
1. system suspend & resume
2. dynamic/runtime/auto/selected suspend & resume
3. LPM - Link Power Management, U0, U1, U2, U3 state
4. PPM - Port Power Management
5. Remote Wakeup

This article is mainly about gadget suspend/resume coding.

### How to setup a usb gadget to support suspend/resume?
Usually, we just need to add the usb descriptors to the usb device's
rom. And when usb host do enumration, device just feedback the specified 
device, configuration, interface and endpointer descriptors.
Then usb host can identify the usb device, and load the accruate usb class driver.
Then do detail control/data transfer through the specified transport pipes.
Therefore, the usb device needs to implement the specified functions too.
Eg, for usb disk, the udisk controller will handle the received usb request block, 
to do emmc/nand-flash read/write operation, and feedback the data through the bulk 
pipe.
Eg, for usb webcam, uvc controller(maybe also an arm soc chip...), will handle the
received URB(usb request block), and upload the webcam's pictures.

According to above description, for a usb device. Just 2 important things.
1. usb descriptors
2. usb functions

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Therefore, except some special usb descriptors(such as BOS for usb3.0), it seems that
there is nothing to setup for suspend/resume.
Every suspend & resume operation is decided by the usb host.  (Maybe usb host will try some pm
operation to judge if the device can support supend/resume.)
So what must be done is the callback function for suspend & resume, which is triggered by the
usb controller's interrupt. (:c:function: dwc3_gadget_linksts_change_interrupt).
Usb interrupt happen, and dispatch the detail event with some eventinfo register.

### Interface for gadget suspend/resume
It seems that no need some setup interface for suspend & resume.
But just implement the c function in c:type:usb_gadget_driver structrue.
.suspend
.resume

If you regist a device with composite device. It already implement a reference suspend/resume
function.
.suspend = composite_suspend,
.resume = composite_resume,

### How to test dynamic suspend/resume?
Everything is controlled by usb host.
When I plug an gadget usb device to host, just goto the specify device's folder, like
/sys/bus/usb/devices/.../power/. And do some operation like below:
echo "auto" > power/control
then wait runtime_status to suspend, and check the gadget link state.
cat /sys/kernel/debug/xxx_usb_control_node/link_state
U3
Then the usb gadget is suspend successfully.

With my test, it seems that, if host PC/Board doesn't have the specified class driver, 
then auto-suspend will be successfully easily. (Eg, adb, g_ether, g_serial succeed to 
dynamic suspend with my host embedded board... But HID & mass storage is failed to dynamic
suspend...)

In summary, if driver is unbound, then it can come in dynamic suspend state easily.
How to unbind the driver with the device??

Just "root@board:/sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb# echo 1-1.2 > unbind"
