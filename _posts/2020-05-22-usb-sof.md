This article is about SOF packet.

### What is SOF?
Start Of Frame!!

For usb full speed protocol, usb host will send a SOF packet to device every
1ms. What means that during 1 second, usb host(PC) will send 1000 SOF packet
to device.

SOF structure is very simple...Just like below:
Field | PID | FrameNumber | CRC5 |
Bits  |  8  |      11     |   5  |

For high/super speed usb bus, usb host (controller) will send SOF packet more
frequently. Every 125us, send a SOF packet.

Therefore, we call 1ms duration's packet as 1 Frame. And 125us's packet as 1
micro Frame.

### What is the usage of SOF packet.
1. It contains frame/micro-frame number, so it can work as synchronization between
host and device.

2. Prevent device come into suspend status. When you check the usb analyzer(such as cat-c)
log, sometimes PC host has nothing to do... No standard request. No specified class request.
No data IN/OUT token.
For example, after choose/set a configuration for usb device, the PC host do nothing for a while
(code is running??  wait for something??). But obviously, PC host won't device to go to suspend status...
As host just set configuration, it's just the begin...
If no any signal/packet in usb bus for a while (3ms??), then usb device will goto suspend status...
Which we call runtime suspend/dynamic suspend.

### That is SOF.
